Implement a memory manager:
Idea:
1. use an array of char of size n. You may decide the value of n.
2. allow the user to decide the allocation policy - first fit, best fit or worst fit.
3. support 
	void* mymalloc(int);
   Allocate a block of required size if possible based on the policy.
   update the status of the block to filled. Note the size allocated.
   update the free list.
4. support
	void free(void *);
	deallocate the block pointed to by the given argument.
    find the size allocated
    mark the block as free
    combine with adjacent freeblocks if any
	update the freelist
