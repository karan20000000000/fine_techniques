//Output expected for given input file:

20 x 5 = 20 5
15 x 25 = 25 15
20 5 x 25 15 = 25 20 15
10 x 3 = 10 3
2 x 18 = 18 2
10 3 x 18 2 = 18 10 2
25 20 15 x 18 10 2 = 25 18 20 15  

20

/*format : 
Each line excepting the last two lines in the output file represents a match played and its result, on either side of the '=' sign, according to the order of the input.

Output set will first have the highest of all elements of the two sets.
This will be followed by the highest number in the losing set.
Finally, the numbers that have lost to the highest number from the winner set are printed.
for example: 
25 20 15 x 18 10 2 = 25 18 20 15  
Here, the two competing sets are 25 20 15 and 18 10 2
The biggest number is 25, and hence is printed first, post the '=' sign.
Hence 25 20 15 is the winning set, and 18 10 2 is the losing set. 
The biggest number of the losing set is 18, and hence is printed as the second number.
This is followed by all the numbers that have lost to 25(ie, 20 15), in the order as that in the winning set itself.

Second last line is a blank line
Last line is the second biggest number.
